Friends of Rabbits is made up of volunteers who simply care about saving bunnies. People are its lifeblood. Without people, Friends of Rabbits would not exist. Friends of rabbits also works with shelters, holding fund raising events such as spa days so that the shelter rabbits can receive veterinary care or be spayed and neutered.
