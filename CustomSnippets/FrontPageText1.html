Friends of Rabbits is an all volunteer, 501c3, nonprofit rabbit rescue group based in the Washington DC / Baltimore greater metropolitan area. We are a small group of working professionals, who in our spare time take in rabbits in need from overwhelmed local shelters and foster them in our own homes.
