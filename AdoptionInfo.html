        <span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Whether you&rsquo;re a first-time adopter or a seasoned rabbit owner, we&rsquo;re delighted you&rsquo;ve made the loving choice to adopt from a rescue group!&nbsp;The first step in adopting a rabbit is to make sure a rabbit is the </span>
        <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/rabbits/tips/rabbits_as_pets.html" style="line-height: 1.42857;">right pet</a>
        <span style="line-height: 1.42857;"> for you. You&rsquo;re also welcome to stop by our adoption events to meet our adoptable rabbits.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you&rsquo;re ready adopt, please submit an<strong style="line-height: 1.42857;">&nbsp;</strong><a href="/forms/form?verify=abc123&amp;formid=3852" style="line-height: 1.42857;">application form</a>
        <span style="line-height: 1.42857;">.&nbsp;</span>
        A trusted FoR volunteer will contact you to discuss any questions you may have and to schedule a brief home visit to check out your future pet&rsquo;s environment. The adoption fee is $75 for a single rabbit and $125 for a bonded pair, which helps to offset the cost of a spay or neuter. Please note that we do not adopt out rabbits to be class pets or for breeding.
    </p>

    <p>Rabbits are very social creatures and are happiest when they have another furry friend to snuggle up to. Particularly if your rabbit will be alone for much of the day, we recommend that you adopt a second rabbit as a companion. However, the bonding process can be quite involved, so Friends of Rabbits assists with bonding at no additional charge.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        <u>Bonding</u><br>
        <span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Contact us to let us know you&rsquo;re interested in bonding your rabbit and we will arrange a time for your bun to speed-date with several adoptable rabbits at a neutral location. After a successful &ldquo;date,&rdquo; a trusted Friends of Rabbits volunteer will take both rabbits for a one-to-two week &ldquo;Bunnymoon&rdquo; at </span>

        <span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Bunny Central</span>

        <span style="line-height: 1.42857;"> where they will get to know each other and solidify their bond.</span>
    </p>

    <p>While they&rsquo;re away at the bunnymoon, you&rsquo;ll want to take the time to make your home as neutral as possible - that means cleaning or replacing rugs, litter boxes, and habitats that smell like your first bunny, and providing some new, neutral-smelling toys. When they first come home be prepared for some marking as the bunnies adjust to a new (or new-smelling) place. Keep them confined to a pen or condo for a couple of days to solidify the bond.&nbsp;</p>
