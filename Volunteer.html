<p>Friends of Rabbits is an all volunteer organization. Anyone who can assist, even in a small way, will be doing a great service to the rabbits and will be much appreciated by all of us. We always need volunteers helping at our events, our foster and pet sitting homes and at numerous other activities that we have throughout the region. Children are welcome to help too. Many of us are either working full time jobs or are very busy with families, school and other important obligations. Our goal is to have many people working together so that each person or family can volunteer as their time allows, enjoy what they are doing and feel gratified that they are making a difference in the lives of each of these rabbits. The following is only a partial list of what some of our volunteers have been doing for the rabbits. Please consider your time and what you may enjoy doing with us.</p>
