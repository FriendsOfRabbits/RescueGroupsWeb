        <span style="line-height: 1.42857;">WHAT WE DO</span>
    </strong>
    <span style="line-height: 1.42857;"><strong>:</strong> Friends of Rabbits rescues, rehabilitates and adopts out more than 100 rabbits each year, and 82% of all donations go directly</span>
    to purchasing supplies and veterinary care for our rabbits. When you adopt from us you truly save a life, enabling our <a href="/info/display?PageID=17125"> volunteers </a>to pull another rabbit in need from local animal control facilities. Our rabbits frequently come from the top of the euthanasia list, often within hours of being put to sleep for lack of space, temperament, and physical imperfections.&nbsp; FoR also works with area shelters to provide rabbit care education and to take in rabbits when the shelters are overloaded.
